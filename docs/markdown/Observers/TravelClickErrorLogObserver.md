## Description

TravelClick Error Log Observer
This observer handles events for the TravelClickErrorLog model.
It acts like a watchful supervisor that reacts to error events,
ensuring proper logging, status updates, and notifications.
Think of this as an emergency response system - when an error occurs,
this observer springs into action to handle the aftermath.

## Methods

### `created`

Handle the TravelClickErrorLog "created" event.
When a new error is logged, this method:
1. Logs to Laravel's standard logging system
2. Updates related sync status if applicable
3. Triggers status change events
4. Handles critical error escalation

```php
public function created(App\TravelClick\Models\TravelClickErrorLog $errorLog): void
```

---

### `updated`

Handle the TravelClickErrorLog "updated" event.
When an error log is updated (usually when resolved),
this method tracks the resolution and updates related statuses.

```php
public function updated(App\TravelClick\Models\TravelClickErrorLog $errorLog): void
```

---

### `deleted`

Handle the TravelClickErrorLog "deleted" event.
Cleanup and logging when error records are removed.

```php
public function deleted(App\TravelClick\Models\TravelClickErrorLog $errorLog): void
```

---

### `creating`

Handle bulk operations efficiently.
This prevents the observer from firing for each individual record
during bulk operations, improving performance.

```php
public function creating(App\TravelClick\Models\TravelClickErrorLog $errorLog): void
```

---

### `withoutEvents`

Handle bulk operations (for performance).
When doing bulk inserts/updates, we might want to disable
observer events to improve performance.

```php
public function withoutEvents(callable $callback)
```
